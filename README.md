A project I made on the OTH Regensburg.

It is a web service, that reproduces some functionalities of Twitter. The main technology, that the project is running on, is Node.js.

To run this project, MongoDB is needed. Path to the data base can be set in 'app/models/db.js'.

Some test data is being created with every start of the Node.js server. For example you can just log in as:

E-mail: homer@simpson.com,
Password: secret

and start searching for the whole Simpson family by typing "simpson" in the search field.
